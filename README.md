**🎙️ Voice Fine-Tuning & Cloning Pipeline**


This project demonstrates a full pipeline for automatic speech transcription, fine-tuning with LoRA, semantic chunking, voice cloning, and evaluation. It integrates Hugging Face Whisper, NLTK, Unsloth, Sesame, and Coqui/SpeechBrain for end-to-end voice adaptation.


**🚀 Features**


📥 Flexible Input: Upload audio files or provide YouTube links.
✍️ Automatic Transcription: Whisper-based, chunked for long audio.
🧩 NLTK Chunking: Extracts structured linguistic units from transcripts.
🔧 Fine-Tuning with LoRA (via Unsloth): Domain-specific speech improvements.
🌱 Sesame Integration: Speaker-aware semantic representation.
🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Voice Cloning: Clone real voices from samples using Coqui/SpeechBrain.
📊 Evaluation: Compare original vs. fine-tuned vs. cloned audio.
📄 Experiment Documentation: Errors, confusion points, resource requirements, and quality metrics logged.

**⚙️ Installation**


Clone the repo:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/voice-finetune-clone.git
cd voice-finetune-clone
Create environment & install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Install optional heavy packages as needed:
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio
pip install unsloth sesame-nlp coqui-tts speechbrain


**▶️ Usage**


1. Transcribe Audio
from pipeline import transcribe
transcribe("data/sample.wav")
2. Fine-Tune with LoRA
from finetune import train_lora
train_lora(dataset="data/", output_dir="results/lora_model")
3. Apply Sesame
from sesame_integration import enhance
enhance("results/lora_model")
4. Voice Cloning
from cloning import clone_voice
clone_voice("data/voice_sample.wav", text="Hello, this is a cloned voice.")
5. Evaluation
from evaluation import compare
compare("data/original.wav", "results/fine_tuned.wav", "results/cloned.wav")
